Problem Statement:
You've been tasked with analyzing data from the "Taxis" table, which contains information about taxi rides including pickup and dropoff locations, number of passengers, distance traveled, fare, tips, tolls, total payment, and various categorical attributes such as color, payment method, and zones. Your goal is to extract insights from this data to help improve taxi services and optimize operations by answering the following questions:


1. What is the distribution of the number of passengers per ride?
2. How does the fare vary with distance traveled?
3. Is there a correlation between the total payment and the number of passengers?
4. Which payment method is the most common?
5. How does the distribution of fares differ between different boroughs?
6. What is the relationship between tip amount and total payment?
   

Findings from the dataset:
1. Most of the rides have only one passenger.
2. The correlation coefficient = 0.95 i.e the higher the distance traveled, the higher the fare.
3. Rides with only 1 passenger made the most amount of payment $83872.75 followed by rides with 2 passengers: $16042.10.
4. Even though cash is used as a mode of payment almost 2000 times, credit card still tops the chart by over 100%.
5. Location Manhattan has the range of payment of between  $5 𝑎𝑛𝑑 $25 with a rare occurernce of  $75 − $125. Location Queens has the range of payment of between  $5 𝑎𝑛𝑑 $60 with a rare occurrence of  $100 − $125.  Location Bronx has the range of payment of between  $12 𝑎𝑛𝑑 $60 with a rare occurrence of  $80 − $90.  Location Brooklyn has the range of payment of between  $5 𝑎𝑛𝑑 $20 with a rare occurrence of  $75 − $110.
6. The correlation coefficient of total payment vs tip amount is 0.65 so there's a possiblity that the higher the total payment, the higher the tip but this is not a strong correlation.
7. Rides with a single passenger had the highest distance in miles compared to rides with other number of passengers.
8. Most riders were tipped with credit cards and the highest tip received was $23.19 from a ride whose distance was 26.92 miles.


Proferred recommendations for the taxi business to help improve taxi services and optimize operations:

1. Optimize Operations for Single Passenger Rides:
Since most rides have only one passenger and they contribute significantly to the total payments, prioritize optimizing operations to cater to this segment. Offering discounts or promotions for single passenger rides during off-peak hours could attract more customers and increase revenue.

2. Distance-Based Fare Pricing:
Given the high correlation coefficient of 0.95 between distance traveled and fare amount, implement a distance-based fare pricing strategy. This can help ensure that customers are charged fairly based on the distance of their rides, which aligns with the observed trend in the dataset.

3. Payment Method Promotion:
Although cash is commonly used as a payment method, credit card payments are more frequent and contribute significantly to the total payments. To further incentivize credit card payments, consider offering rewards or discounts for customers who choose this payment method. Additionally, ensure that payment processing systems are reliable and user-friendly to encourage more customers to use credit cards.

4. Location-Specific Pricing Strategies:
Implement location-specific pricing strategies based on the payment range and rare occurrence observations for different pickup/dropoff locations. This can involve adjusting fare rates or offering targeted promotions to attract more customers from specific areas.

5. Encourage Tipping Culture:
With a correlation coefficient of 0.65 between total payment and tip amount, it is evident that tips contribute to the total revenue of taxi drivers. Encourage tipping culture among customers by providing excellent customer service, maintaining clean and comfortable vehicles, and offering incentives for customers who tip generously.

6. Efficient Single Passenger Ride Allocation:
Since rides with a single passenger have the highest distance traveled compared to rides with other numbers of passengers, optimize the allocation of single passenger rides to drivers to maximize efficiency. This can involve using data-driven algorithms to match single passengers with available drivers efficiently, reducing wait times and increasing customer satisfaction.

7. Track and Reward High-Tip Rides:
Identify and track rides where customers provide high tips, such as the ride with a $23.19 tip for a 26.92-mile distance. Reward drivers who consistently receive high tips with incentives or bonuses to incentivize excellent service and encourage repeat business.
